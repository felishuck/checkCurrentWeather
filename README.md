# Check Current Weather

Hey there!!

After posting my version of a weather mobile app, that originaly called iWeather 😆, I wanted to spend sometime on working with Core Location to obtain the users' current location, so that I could provide them with the weather information. At the same time, I had the chance to experiment with Async/Await in order to deal with asyncronous operations when requesting information from the weather API. I have to say that working with Async/Await makes working with asynchronous operartion much easier and intuitive than before.

The way this app works is not a rocket science, the main screen just has a text field, where the user can enter the name of the place he wants to check or, in case wanting to check his current location, he can just pressing the button withour inserting any city name. One the button is tapped, the app will show the result with a little animation, removing that information fromt the screen in a few seconds latter.
